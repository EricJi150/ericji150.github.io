📚 I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. I am part of the Computational Imaging Group (CIG) under Professor Minh Do and work closely with Professor Yaoyao Liu in the Computer Vision and Machine Learning Group.

🖥️ My research interests are in image feature matching and image generation.

🎣 My personal hobbies include fishing, golf, weightlifting, and gaming.

**I will be interning at Siemens as a GenAI intern this summer!**
